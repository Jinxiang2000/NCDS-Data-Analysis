    "#### Abstract\n",
    "- In this project, we will explore how minority and transferred students affect school environment such as racial tension, violent incidents, and also how school location influence transferred students rate. We will also explore how urbanacity,violent incidents, school size and crime level influence number of transferred students;\n",
    "- The aims of the project are to answer if the presence of minority students aggravates racial tension. Also, we aim to explore possible factors that influence number of transferred students. \n",
    "- From the analysis, we have found that the presence of minority students both aggravate the level of racial tension and increase violent incidents. The higher the minority percentage is, the larger the amount of violent incidents occur and the larger the higher level racial tensions (level 5, 8, 10) is. We also conclude that generally the increase of violent influences means the increase in number of transferred students. Also, urbanicty will lead to more transferred studnets: with larger school sizes in city, more transferred students we have; smaller school sizes in town, less transferred students we have. Moreover, we also find that an association between crime level and number of transferred students. \n"

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The National Education Statistics Center (NCES) is the main federal entity that collects and analyzes education-related data in the United States and other countries. NCES performs the duties of Congress to collect, organize, analyze, and report complete statistical data on the state of education in the United States; conduct and publish reports; review and report on international education activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data our group use for this project is called the School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS), which is the main source of NCES school-level crime and security data. SSOCS is a sample survey of approximately 4,800 public primary and secondary schools. It aims to provide estimates of school crime, discipline, disorder, programs and policies, and is large enough to provide a national estimate of all public schools. SSOCS is administered in the spring of the school year so that the principal can report the most complete information possible. Specifically, we use the data set from the 2005-06 school year. In the raw data, the SSOCS questionnaire requires principals to report on various topics related to crime and safety, including school practices and plans, parent and community involvement in schools, school security personnel, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, two topics we plan to explore are:\n",
    "1. Does the presence of minority students aggravate racial tension?\n",
    "2. What factors can affect the number of transfer students?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Aims\n",
    "The first question aims to answer if the presence of minority students aggravates racial tension. Since racial tension has always been an issue in the society, and the tragic death of George Floyd really provoked people into the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement. Moreover, since the pandemic, \"Asian hate crime\" has been happening quite frequently. Since school violence is a topic that many people concern about now, we feel like it is important to see if there is a relationship between the presence of minority students and racial tension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second question aims to explore the relationship between variables: urbanicity, number of transferred students, school sizses, and crime rates. Since we believe that these variables are important signs of whether a school can provide a safe and good environment for students, we then uses statistical methods: simple linear regression, mutiple linear regression to study the dataset. We are intersted to see whether crime level, school size, and urbanicity impact a students' transfer decision or not. Through the progress, we also look at other variables like school sizes and urbanicity altogether. "

    "##### General description: \n",
    "The data are school survey on crime and safety that gathered responses from approximately 4,800 public elementary and secondary schools from 2005–06 school year. The survey is administrated during the spring of the school year for the principals to report the most complete information possible.\n",

    "##### Collection methods: \n",
    "The data are collected from the surveys distributed to approximately 4,800 public elementary and secondary school principals in the U.S. during 2005–06 school year. School principals are in charge of filling out the survey each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sampling design and scope of inference: \n",
    "The relevant population is all U.S. elementary and secondary schools. The sampling frame is all U.S. elementary and secondary school principals recorded. The sampling mechanism is random sample since all school principals have equal likelihood of being selected to participate in this survey. The scope of inference is broad since the sample is said to be representative of the population. The sample could be used to safely extrapolate all U.S. elementary and secondary schools' crime and safety situations.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first question studies the relationship between minority and racial tension via comparing the percentage of minority, racial tensions, and the number of violent incidents happened. Changes in racial tensions are identified for different level of minority percentage as well as changes in the number of violent incidents, derived from several line and scatter plots. Furthermore, under the bar chart, there is strong signal in the percentage of minority about each racial tensions, based on sample sizes of each racial tensions in each level of minority percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second question studies the relationship between number of transferred students and number of violent incidents via simple linear regression. We also explored the relationship between the number of transferred students and other catogorical variables: school sizes and urbanicity through mutiple linear regession. Specifically, we explore the data first by scatterplots and tables to analyze their relationships. Further, we use formula in simple linear regression (SLR) and mutiple linear regression (MLR) to explore their coefficeints, stardard errors....."

    "For example: the estimate for `Moderate crime level` is  -0.069188; that means that, if urbanicity and school size are held fixed, the estimated difference in mean log transferred students between moderate crime level is  -0.069188. If $\\log(a) - \\log(b) =  -0.069188$, then $\\frac{a}{b} = e^{ -0.069188} \\approx 0.933151$; so the estimated transferred students (not on the log scale) differ by a factor of about 1. Further, the standard error is  0.088358 , so the estimate is within 4SE of 0; the difference could well be zero. So the model suggests there is no difference in transferred studnets by crime level"

    "5. Finally, it is reasonable to conclude that from the four plots, they share similar trend in each crime level, comparing urbanicity against estimated mean log transfer. \n",
    "6.  Therefore, from the above analysis, we conclude that urbanicity and school size affect the number of transferred students. \n",
    "+ Students tend to transfer to colleges in big cities because there are more resources in the urban area, such as more opportunities for internships and better living quality.\n",
    "+  School size also influences a student's transfer decision. Large school size is often associated with abundant alumni resources. On the other hand, school size an indicator of popularity because a large school usually has more applicants. \n",
    "+ Surprisingly, according to the data visualization, there seemed to be an association between crime level and the number of transfer students. The mean log transfer is roughly the same for the high level and the median level of crime; however, the mean log transfer for the low crime level is lower compared with other crime levels. This is counter-intuitive and we suspect multicollinearity exists between Urbanicity and crime level.\n"

This result corresponds to our assumption in the previous section. Therefore, collinearity between urbanicity and crime level exists. Collinearity increase the variance of a regression fit. To address this issue, it's necessary to disregard crime level because it is redundant for our regression model."

    "To sum up, the presence of minority students both aggravate the level of racial tension and increase violent incidents. The higher the minority percentage is, the larger the amount of violent incidents occur and the larger the higher level racial tensions (level 5, 8, 10) is. The reason of this phenomenon may be the ingrained racial discrimination towards minority group in society that has influenced the students at school. Importantly, throughout analyzing, we neglect the “Do Not Know” group because it may contain data from different level of minority percentage, whose analysis has no reference value.\n",

    "In second study, we use exploratory analysis, simple linear regression and mutiple linear regression to find out possible factors that affect the number of transfer students. In particular, we analyze the relationship between the variables: school sizes, transferred students, urbanicity, and crime level. In scatterplot, we learned that school with larger school size attracts more transferred students.  Also, we observe a potential connection between crime levels and urbanicity. By observing the Seaborn heatmap, we discover that there is a mild collinearity between urbanicity and crime levels.We conclude that school size and urbanicity affect the number of transfer students; however, due to the low R-square value of the SLR model and multicollinearity, there is little evidence to show that the number of transfers correlates with the violent incident or crime levels.\n"
